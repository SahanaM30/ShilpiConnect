## 💡 The Problem

India is losing its traditional crafts at an alarming rate. **Master artisans** with 40+ years of experience struggle to find apprentices, while **young people** interested in learning these crafts don't know where to start. This disconnect is causing centuries-old heritage skills to disappear forever.

## 🎯 The Solution

**ShilpiConnect** is a web platform that bridges this gap by connecting master artisans with eager learners through intelligent matching algorithms, helping preserve India's rich cultural heritage.

### 2. 📚 Learner Registration  
- Aspiring learners register with their interests and location
- Simple interface to find master artisans nearby
- Direct contact information for immediate connection

### 3. 🤝 Smart Matching System

- **Geographic Proximity** (30% weight) - Same city or nearby locations
- Only displays high-quality matches (>50% compatibility score)

### 4. 🔍 Search & Browse
- Search artisans by specific craft type
- Browse all registered artisans and learners
- View detailed profiles with contact information

### 5. 📊 Impact Statistics
